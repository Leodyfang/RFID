# RFID
Arduino Library
This repo list a RFID library based on NXP MFRC522 and an Arduino UNO with a joyStick for controlling. Also there is a PDF with courses for college student in polytech.
This project is just a sample, there maybe bugs, faults for advanced use.

Any suggestion will be appreciated.
